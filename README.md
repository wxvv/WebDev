# The Web Developer Bootcamp

 Welcome to the Web Developer Bootcamp, the only course you need to learn web development. 
 
 This will be my place to record most of my codes from the exercises.

 It's been 300 years since I last opened this course. 
 But, I have no intention to give this up, 
 and with all the web scraping coming up these days, 
 I think it is time for me to restart my journey with this bootcamp again. 
 So, wish me luck.
